        <h2>1.Machine language</h2><p>
            A computer can only process binary: a stream of ones and zeros. Binary is the computerâ€™s
             language. Instructions for the computer are also stored as ones and zeros that the comp
             uter must decode and execute.

        <h2>2.Assembly language</h2><p>
            Assembly language is low-level code that relies on a strong relationship between the ins
            tructions input using the coding language and how a machine interprets the code instruct
            ions. Code is converted into executable actions using an assembler that converts input i
            nto recognizable instructions for the machine.

        <h2>3.Graphical user interface</h2><p>
            A graphical user interface (GUI) is a digital interface in which a user interacts with g
            raphical components such as icons, buttons, and menus. In a GUI, the visuals displayed in
             the user interface convey information relevant to the user, as well as actions that they
              can take

        <h2>3.High-Level Language</h2><p>
            A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program 
            in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the com
            puter's hardware architecture.
            A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses m
            ore on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memor
            y addressing and register utilization.

        <h2>4.IDE</h2><P>
            An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
