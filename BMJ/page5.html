        <h3>:CSS is a style sheet language used for formatting content in HTML webpages. CSS style sheets can define the appearance and formatting of text, tables, and other elements separately from the content itself. Styles may be found within a webpage's HTML file or in a separate document referenced by multiple webpages.</h3>

        <h2>VI.WHAT IS IDE?</h2>
        <h3>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.
            Developers use numerous tools throughout software code creation, building and testing. Development tools often include text editors, code libraries, compilers and test platforms. Without an IDE, a developer must select, deploy, integrate and manage all of these tools separately. An IDE brings many of those development-related tools together as a single framework, application or service. The integrated toolset is designed to simplify software development and can identify and minimize coding mistakes and typos.
            Some IDEs are open source, while others are commercial offerings. An IDE can be a standalone application or it can be part of a larger package.</h3>

        <h3>
                At The beginning of the semester I thought this subject would be just be discussing basic computer things which things would be boring but thankfully sir gabo teachers us some usefull stuff like the binary html and many more.I realize that being IT student is very hard as i need to memorize all of the code commands of a computer language and its even more harder if you are studying 2 computer language at the same time just like the this semester we tacle JAVA Programing and html at the same time, but despite that I got no choice but to keep going forward.
