        <h2>1.Motherboard</h2><p>
        The system board is the main logic board
        in any laptop. All internal components are
        connected to the system board. This is one
        of the most expensive parts in a laptop.

        <h2>2.Processor</h2><p>
            A central processing unit (CPU) formerly also referred
            to as a central processor unit is the hardware within a
            computer that carries out the instructions of a
            computer by performing the basic arithmetical,
            logical, and input or output operations of the system.

        <h2>3.Memory or RAM</h2><p>
            Random access memory (RAM) is used as the working
            memory of a computer system. It stores input data,
            intermediate results, programs, and other information
            temporarily. It can be read and written. It is usually
            volatile, that is all data will be lost when the power is
            turned off. In most cases it is loaded again from hard disk.

        <h2>4.Hard Disk Drive </h2><p>
            The hard drive is the main storage of information in a
            laptop. All system files, personal files are stored inside the
            hard drive. Find the difference between SATA and IDE
            hard drives. Faster hard drive you have installed â€“ faster
            data access you get.
            Types of Hard Disk
            1. IDE Interface
            2. SATA Interface

        <h2>5.Heat Sink w/ Cooling Fan</h2><p>
            In computers, heat sinks are used to cool
            central processing units or graphics processors.

        <h2>6.Keyboard</h2><p>
            Is a typewriter-style device, which uses an
            arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as
            mechanical levers or electronic switches.
            Typically has characters engraved or printed on
            the keys and each press of a key typically
            corresponds to a single written symbol.

        <h2>7.LCD Inverter</h2><p>
            An LCD (liquid-crystal display) inverter is a
            component in laptop computers that supplies
            the power to provide a backlight to the
            monitor, enabling the user to view what's on the
            screen. This component is commonly the culprit
            when the monitor goes out and can be
            moderately simple to replace.
        </p>
        <img src="images/monitor.png" alt="">
        <h2>8.LCD/LED Display Monitor</h2><p>
            A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat panel display,
            electronic visual display, or video display that uses the
            light modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid
            crystals do not emit light directly. LCDs are used in a
            wide range of applications including computer
            monitors, televisions, instrument panels, aircraft
            cockpit displays, and signage.

        <img src="images/Optical Drives.png" alt="">
        <h2>9.Optical Drives</h2><p>
            An optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that
            uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within
            or near the visible light spectrum as part of the
            process of reading or writing data to or from
            optical discs. Some drives can only read from
            discs, but recent drives are commonly both
            readers and recorders, also called burners or
            writers.

        <img src="images/cmos.png" alt="">
        <h2>10.CMOS Battery (RTC)</h2><p>
            The CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide
            Semiconductor) battery provides power to the
            CMOS chip when the laptop is not powered on. The
            CMOS memory stores the date, time, and system
            setup parameters. Without the CMOS Battery, the
            CMOS would not be able to continuously keep track
            of the date and time while your computer is off.

        <img src="images/Power Adapter.png" alt="">
        <h2>11.Power Adapter</h2><p>
            Also called an "AC adapter" or a "charger" if
            used to recharge a battery, it plugs into the
            wall and converts AC current to a single DC
            voltage in most cases. There are also adapters
            that output a different AC voltage. Laptops
            have both an external power adapter, also
            called a "power brick," and an internal power
            supply. If an external power adapter is not
            used with an electronic product such as a
            desktop computer, the DC current is created in
            a power supply inside the unit
